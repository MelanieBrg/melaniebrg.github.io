In today's fast-paced world, technology has become an integral part of our daily lives, and it's continually reshaping the way we go about our routines. Augmented Reality (AR) is one such technology that holds the potential to enhance human abilities and make our lives more efficient and enjoyable. In this blog article, I present an innovative project aimed at transforming the way we plan meals, manage kitchen inventory, and shop for groceries – all through the lens of AR.

### Enhanced Augmented Alimentation: AR Meal Planning, Inventory Management, and Shopping Assistance

#### Concept:
An integrated AR application that combines meal planning, kitchen inventory management, and shopping assistance to streamline the entire food preparation process.

Interaction:

1. Enhanced meal planning 
- Meal Planning: Users input their dietary preferences and select meals they'd like to prepare for a set duration (e.g., a week).
- Inventory Scanning: Users scan the barcodes or visually identify food items in their kitchen, which the AR app recognizes and adds to their virtual kitchen inventory.
- Auto-Generated Shopping List: The app cross-references the chosen meals with the inventory and generates a shopping list for missing ingredients.

2. Enhanced Shopping Assistance
Grocery Store Navigation: When users go shopping, the AR app provides optimal in-store navigation to locate items, along with real-time stock updates.

3. Enhanced Cooking Assistance
Cooking Assistant: For each meal, the app offers step-by-step cooking instructions and timers using AR overlays.



#### Prototype:


Let's break down the components of the prototype:

- Logging In / Signing Up:

Users start by logging in or signing up. This step ensures that the app can personalize their meal planning and shopping experience.

- Meal Planning, Inventory Management and Grocery List Generation:

Users specify what they'd like to eat for the week, along with the number of people.
They use camera buttons to scan the food items they already have in their kitchen.The AI component processes the scanned items and generates a list of groceries needed for the planned meals.

- Shopping Optimization:

Users have the option to click on "Go shopping," which connects the app to their AR headset.
The app uses AR technology to provide an optimized path for shopping in their favorite grocery store.


### Evaluation

I tried this prototype on my family and here are some feed back on the different functionnalities :

- The login/sign-up process was straightforward and user-friendly. They didn't encounter any issues during this stage.
- One suggestion is to consider adding a navigation bar at the bottom of the app. It would make it more convenient to switch between different sections of the app, especially when navigating through the AR headset. This could improve the overall user experience.
