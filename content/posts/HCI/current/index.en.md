Mobile phones have come a long way in terms of design over the past decade. In this blog post, we'll take a closer look at the evolution of mobile phone design and shape, with a specific focus on weight, thickness, and display size.

#### Weight Matters:
Mobile phone manufacturers have been on a mission to make our devices smaller and lighter. While the average weight of mobile phones has remained relatively consistent, it's worth noting that modern high-end smartphones now pack more features into smaller, lighter packages. However, the quest for feature-rich phones has driven the trend towards slightly heavier devices. The finish of a phone, such as metal or tempered glass, can add to its weight.

#### Thin is In:
Slimness has become a defining factor in mobile phone design. The trend towards thinner phones gained momentum with iconic models like the Motorola RAZR V3. High-end phones have increasingly embraced slim profiles, with a notable gap emerging between high-end and average devices. Nevertheless, there's a limit to how thin a phone can be while remaining durable. Extremely slim phones may not withstand regular use, and there's a consensus that most users don't need them to be any slimmer. So, high-end smartphone thickness may find its ideal balance in the near future.

#### Bigger Displays:
When it comes to display size, the mantra seems to be "bigger is better." Advances in screen resolution have made larger screens more appealing. While some argue that smaller, high-resolution displays offer a sharper image, most users prefer larger screens for their everyday tasks. Phone screens have been steadily growing in size, with some crossing the 5-inch threshold. However, it's uncertain whether phones will continue to grow beyond this point, as ergonomic considerations may limit further size increases.
