## Exploring the Pioneering HCI Research of Dr. Elizabeth Churchill


#### Brief introduction

[Dr. Elizabeth Churchill](http://elizabethchurchill.com), currently a Director of User Experience at Google in Mountain View, California, has drawn on social, computer, engineering and data sciences to create innovative end-user applications and services for the past 20 years.


#### Academic Background
She holds a PhD from the University of Cambridge, an honorary Doctor of Science (DSc.) from the University of Sussex, and in September will be awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Stockholm. In 2016 she received a Citris-Banatao Institute Award Athena Award for Women in Technology for her Executive Leadership.



#### Current Research Projects
Dr. Elizabeth Churchill, a distinguished research scientist, is currently delving into the dynamic field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Her primary research interests revolve around designing and evaluating technologies that enhance communication and connection among individuals.

Specifically, Dr. Churchill is focused on exploring novel HCI solutions for social contexts. Her work encompasses various facets of human interaction, including community-building, collaboration, communication enhancement, coordination, consensus-building, competition, compassion, and creativity. Her research not only seeks to design interactive applications but also to understand how people ingeniously integrate and adapt these technologies into their daily lives.

Moreover, Dr. Churchill is intrigued by the evolving digital media landscape and "Internet ethnoscapes," a term she borrows from Arjun Appadurai. This concept refers to the ever-shifting dynamics of individuals and groups in digital spaces, such as online communities and social media platforms.

Her research approach takes a cross-cultural perspective, drawing from her experiences working in Japan, the United States, and the United Kingdom. She is keenly interested in how social technologies and social media are adopted and adapted within diverse cultural and social settings.

Dr. Churchill's research is informed by a multidisciplinary approach, integrating insights from psychology, sociology, anthropology, cultural studies, urban studies, and film studies. Her professional interests span various areas within HCI, including interactive technology design, social media, augmented and virtual reality, and user experience (UX). In her quest to understand and improve the human-computer interaction landscape, she continues to innovate and contribute to the HCI field.
