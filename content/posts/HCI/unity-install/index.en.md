I installed Unity on Mac M1 sucessfully and in this article I'll provide a brief step-by-step guide on how to install Unity based on Léa Saunier's tutorial.


##### Step 1: Download Unity Hub
Begin by downloading Unity Hub from https://unity.com/download. Unity Hub acts as a central management tool for your Unity projects and installations.

##### Step 2: Connect Your Account/License
Open Unity Hub and log in with your Unity account or license to access Unity's features and manage your licenses.

##### Step 3: Install Unity 2022.3.2f1
Install the recommended Unity version, 2022.3.2f1, by clicking this link: unityhub://2022.3.2f1/d74737c6db50. Unity Hub will handle the installation process for you.


##### Step 4: Install Required Modules
Customize your Unity installation by installing modules for specific platforms like iOS, Windows, or Android. Unity Hub simplifies the process by allowing you to select the modules you need.


##### Step 5: Install a Code Editor
It's highly recommended to install Visual Studio alongside Unity. This option will provide a robust code editor and seamlessly integrate with Unity. Unity will prompt you to install the Unity plugin for Visual Studio to enhance your workflow.

##### Step 6 : Enjoy !
